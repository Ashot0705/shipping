# Express Shipping

## Objective

Create a Rails application for Express Shipping to help them organize all of the ships in their ï¬‚eet, with a user login system using the gem Devise. The application should be able to, at its most basic, allow users to:

* Sign In and Sign Out

* Create an account

* Create a boat

* Validations for account

* Selections of Origins and Destinatons

* add new boats to their account, meant to be managed by that user, including a boat name, amount of containers able to ship, and current boat location

## Jobs

* must have a unique name

* cost must be greater than or equal to $1000 for each job

* cargo description must be at least 50 characters

* origin and destinations must be pulled from a valid list of locations (use a hard-coded list)

## Boats

* Must have a unique name

* locations must be pulled from a valid list of locations (use a hard-coded list)

## Adding Rails UJS and Paperclip

* Using Rails UJS enable the user to add a boat to a job without reloading the page

* Using the paperclip gem, give a user the ability to upload a photo of a ship when the ship is being created
